    <p><em><h2>Overview</h2></em></p>
    <p>*Click* Scroll, Doubletap, Like, Repost, Share and Post. Whether we are on our phones, tablets or desktops we have all had the temption to check our profiles on different social sites; and we do it more than once throughtout the day.Social media is becoming more relevant and innovating especially with all these different feautres and applications that are popping up in our app store. Snapchat, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter are just a few of the major sites that people visit. Social media has become more than just a medium of self-experssion but it has become a place where we can stay in tune with current events, where people can come together from all over the world, where people can have instant communication. Also Social media is just general fun and enjoyment in all its aspects. These platforms have become an intergral part of our online lives. Social networks are a great way to stay connected with others, but you should be wary about how much personal information you post.</p>

    <p>According to people in their twenties and early thirties surveyed across the country, there’s an increasingly disillusioned feeling surrounding social networks. Once targeted ads hit Instagram, it seemed like we’d reached a point of no return. As those surveyed detailed, in this day and age it’s virtually impossible to have the same reasonable expectation of privacy that previous generations enjoyed, and yet no one wants to feel like a guinea pig for direct marketing online. Yes, these ads enable us to use social platforms for free, but it’s also creepy as hell to see something you once randomly Googled at 2 AM pop up in a feed without thinking you’d agreed to it.</p>

    <p>Overall, a 2014 survey found that 91% of Americans “agree” or “strongly agree” that people have lost control over how personal information is collected and used by all kinds of entities. Some 80% of social media users said they were concerned about advertisers and businesses accessing the data they share on social media platforms, and 64% said the government should do more to regulate advertisers.</p>

    <p>Another survey last year found that just 9% of social media users were “very confident” that social media companies would protect their data. About half of users were not at all or not too confident their data were in safe hands.</p>
    <p><em>Which means that most people are using social media knowing that there is a privacy issue.</em></p>
